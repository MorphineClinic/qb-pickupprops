# qb-pickupprops

requirements fr:
qb-target (you can switch this in the code if you want it to support other frameworks)

ngl i cant be bothered to remake this readme cuz ive already put a bunch of comments within the code so just go off

no license

btw this might cause a error saying AddTargetModel isnt a thing in the client console, just rename the script to qbpickupprops instead of qb-pickupprops
